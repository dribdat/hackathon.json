hackathon.json Specification
----------------------------

A standard data format for publishing evidence of public participation in technical events.

# Overview

Our goals are to have a shared and linked metadata and data model for opening data from and about hackathons. Here we describe how this may be published in the [JSON serialization for Linked Data](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://json-ld.org/&ved=2ahUKEwifyq272qGJAxV48LsIHe-qFuMQFnoECAgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0KYV5lDp9ZQ0M18tp93C6E) (JSON-LD, or just `json`) format. 

# Basic type

The data model for `hackathon.json` is based on the [Hackathon type](https://schema.org/Hackathon) at Schema.org, which defines the properties and sub-entities involved in describing an event of this type. 

The essentials of this is a header that includes a `@context` and `@type` reference, along with top-level properties such as `name` and `startDate`, as follows:

```
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "Hackathon",
  "name": "GLAMhack 2024",
  "startDate": "2024-09-06T09:00",
  "endDate": "2024-09-07T16:00",
  ...
}
```

# Location

The geographic location of the event, if it has a physical address or geocoordinates, can be documented with the [Location](https://schema.org/location) property, which may be formatted as a `Place`, `PostalAddress`, `VirtualLocation`, or just be a plain `Text` description.

# Offers

Using the [offers](https://schema.org/offers) property, we can describe requirements of joining the hackathon, just as the obligation to buy a ticket or join a waiting list.

# CreativeWork

The Schema.org type proposes the use of [CreativeWork](https://schema.org/CreativeWork) sub-entities to document the results of an event. This would include a `@context`, as well as `name`, `dateCreated` and so on. You can see this in the example below.
